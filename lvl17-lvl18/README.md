## Level 17 -> Level 18 solution

The password for the next level is in password.new and is the only line that has been changed betwen passwords.old and passwords.new .

To help us solve this challenge we'll use the `diff` command, which displays the differences between the contents of files.

We use the `-u` flag to unified output format an improved version of the context format.

```console
diff -u passwords.new passwords.old
--- passwords.new       2020-05-07 20:14:35.528729706 +0200
+++ passwords.old       2020-05-07 20:14:35.376729786 +0200

We can notice in our output that some lines are preceded by a `-` and `+` char, the minus symbol rappresent the lines that have been removed and the plus symbol the one that have been added.
Given this information we can grab the line that have been removed and use it to access the next level.
