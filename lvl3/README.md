## Level 3 solution

In this level we have a file that contains spaces inside his name.
We could approach this problem in two different ways.
Solution 1:
Type the name of the file inside a string
```
cat 'spaces in this filename'
```
or escape the spaces characters:
```
cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
```
That's it!
